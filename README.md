# Nadeshiko
Nadeshiko is a library for easy GUI development in C.  
  
Basically, I needed a way to develop GUIs fast for my uni assignments (I couldn't just give back a program that runs in a terminal, could I?), so I made this.. 
It's not perfect but it does what I want. Don't expect many feature updates, I'll prob just implement stuff when I need it. (PRs are open tho..)  

Also, there's no support outside of Linux for now. Windows will eventually be tested (the teachers use Windows.. sad..) but I can't promise anything related to Macos..  


  
If you like this project please do find it in your heart to starr (I want shiny new badge on profile ðŸ˜‹)
